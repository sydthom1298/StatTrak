This program is StatTrak, an Android app designed to make it easy to gather player statistics during a basketball game. It is geared toward the beginner, such as a parent or other volunteer for high school or youth basketball but
it can also be used by anyone that wants to track the basic statistics and be able to do it quickly and easily.
